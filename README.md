QuANTs
======

The purpose of QuANTs is to provide quality assurance and assessment for [Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs)](https://github.com/stnava/ANTs). Specifically, routines will be provided to evaluate the output of scripts inlcluded with ANTs such as antsCorticalThickness and antsNeuroimagingBattery. A two-layer approach will be taken:
1) Cluster based generatation of csv files and images for individual data sets
2) Generation of summary csv files, graph and images for large sets of data (studies, etc)
